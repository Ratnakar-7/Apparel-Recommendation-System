The data has various features :
1) Title of the product, the description of the production in 10-20 words ( most important feature )
2) Brand of the product
3) Color
4) Type/Category of the product

In this project I've tried out various strategies used for the recommendation.

1) Bag of Words (BOW)
2) Term Frequency (TF)
3) Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
4) TF-IDF
5) Word2Vec 
6) CNN, VGG-16 Model  ( for image based recommedation )
